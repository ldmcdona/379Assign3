Liam McDonald

We broke down the project into three major sections; the hash function, the linked list function, and general functionality.
Work was divided according to sections and availability. 

Liam was primarily responcible for the hash function. This included not only the hashing itself but additional functionality used in manipulation and management of the hash table, testing, and compatability. 

Craig was primarily responcible for the linked list function, including all additional functionality required to properly manipulate and manage the linked list, as well as functionality for testing and compatability. 

General functionality was originally a collaborative effort between Craig and Liam, however availability became an issue and the later work on general functionality was done primarily by Craig, with Liam moving to an assisting role. 

Program testing was done with the Virtual Machine and was found to be working.
